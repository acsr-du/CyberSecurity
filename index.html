                <p>Advanced Cyber Security Research Group (ACSR) of Department of Computer Science, Doon University, is a
                    creative and active group of engineering/computer science undergraduates, post graduates and Ph. D.
                    scholars working under supervision of Dr. Preeti Mishra, Assistant Prof., Computer Science, Doon
                    University, Dehradun. The main motive of this group is to provide a learning environment to promote the
                    innovative, collaborative and interdisciplinary research. ACSR provides a common research platform to
                    students where they together learn, improve and apply their technical skills in designing and developing
                    innovative research projects. Currently, it comprises of members pursuing UG/PG/PhD from Doon University
                    Dehradun, working under the guidance of Dr. Preeti Mishra. It also comprises of alumni working in
                    reputed firms and continuing their research. ACSR has been informally started in 2021 with a few
                    undergraduate students. However, it is expanded over a time period to foster the research environment in
                    India and helping people in solving real world cyber problems. We have organized students’ skill
                    development workshops such as Data Analytics workshops, sponsored by Honeywell and Power BI workshop,
                    sponsored by Marico and various cyber security related invited talks and guest lectures. We participated
                    in 2022 Fourteenth International Conference on Contemporary Computing, Noida Delhi and 2023
                    International Conference on Advances in Intelligent Computing and Applications (AICAPS), Kochi Kerala
                    and 2023 Fourteenth International Conference on Contemporary Computing, Noida, Delhi which are related
                    to a multitude of fields. We have done the core research with publishing research articles in reputed
                    publications like IEEE SCI Journal, Elsevier SCI Journals and various reputed Int. Conferences held at
                    Indian and Abroad Universities. Our specialization and main focus are on Adversarial machine learning,
                    Online antivirus service development, Cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Machine learning (ML),
                    cyber security, android application, android security, Hypervisor security, Docker security etc. Over
                    the last few years, our team have gained expertize on various programming languages like C, C++, Python,
                    hypervisor like Xen, KVM, introspection tools like LibVMI, DRAKVUF etc, machine learning frameworks
                    Jupyter , sensor-based applications, hacking tools, Hadoop, HIVE, OpenStack, A­­WS Cloud and research
                    paper writing tools such as Latex, Endnote and Medley.</p>

                <p>The consistent teamwork coupled with perseverance, proper guidance, and stimulating challenges have
                    gained us numerous significant achievements. We have developed various projects such as “HyperGuard: on
                    designing out-VM malware analysis approach to detect intrusions from hypervisor in cloud environment”,
                    “CROPCARE: An Intelligent Real-Time Sustainable IoT System for Crop Disease Detection Using Mobile
                    Vision”, “vServiceInspector: Introspection-assisted evolutionary bag-of-ngram approach to detect malware
                    in cloud servers”, “A holistic survey on the use of emerging technologies to provision secure healthcare
                    solutions”, “VNSecure: An explainable virtual network attack detection framework at VMM-Layer in
                    virtualization environment”, “DeepHyperv: A deep neural network based virtual
                    memory analysis for malware detection at hypervisor-layer” and “Advanced malware and their impact on
                    virtualization: A case study on hybrid feature extraction using deep memory
                    Introspection”, etc. Currently, we are working on adversarial machine learning in malware detection and
                    the concept drift in network intrusion detection. We promote the collaboration of external Indian and
                    foreign organizations to improve the quality of research and build a relationship with collaborating
                    institutes and industries. Currently, we are collaborating in research with Advanced Cyber Security
                    Research Center (ACSRC), The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, Australia, and the Indian Institute of
                    Technology, Roorkee, University of Padua, Italy. An MoU has recently been initiated between the
                    International Center for AI and Cyber Security Research and Innovations, Asia University Taiwan, and
                    Doon University, Dehradun. We are looking forward to add active and consistent students to our team. Those who would like to join
                    the team may contact the team mentor.
