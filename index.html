        <h2 id="heading">About Us</h3>
        <p>Advanced Cyber Security Research Group (ACSR) of Department of Computer Science, Doon University, is a creative and active group of engineering/computer science undergraduates, post graduates and Ph. D. scholars working under supervision of Dr. Preeti Mishra, Assistant Prof., Computer Science, Doon University, Dehradun. The main motive of this group is to provide a learning environment to promote the innovative, collaborative and interdisciplinary research. ACSR provides a common research platform to students where they together learn, improve and apply their technical skills in designing and developing innovative research projects. Currently, it comprises of members pursuing UG/PG/PhD from Doon University Dehradun, working under the guidance of Dr. Preeti Mishra. It also comprises of alumni working in reputed firms and continuing their research. ACSR has been informally started in 2021 with a few undergraduate students. However, it is expanded over a time period to foster the research environment in India and helping people in solving real world cyber problems. We have organized students’ skill development workshops such as Data Analytics workshops, sponsored by Honeywell and Power BI workshop, sponsored by Marico and various cyber security related invited talks and guest lectures. We participated in 2022 Fourteenth International Conference on Contemporary Computing, Noida Delhi and 2023 International Conference on Advances in Intelligent Computing and Applications (AICAPS), Kochi Kerala and 2023 Fourteenth International Conference on Contemporary Computing, Noida, Delhi which are related to a multitude of fields. We have done the core research with publishing research articles in reputed publications like IEEE SCI Journal, Elsevier SCI Journals and various reputed Int. Conferences held at Indian and Abroad Universities. Our specialization and main focus are on Adversarial machine learning, Online antivirus service development, Cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), Machine learning (ML), cyber security, android application, android security, Hypervisor security, Docker security etc. Over the last few years, our team have gained expertize on various programming languages like C, C++, Python, hypervisor like Xen, KVM, introspection tools like LibVMI, DRAKVUF etc, machine learning frameworks (Jupyter , sensor-based applications, hacking tools, Hadoop, HIVE, OpenStack, A­­WS Cloud and research paper writing tools such as Latex, Endnote and Medley.</p>
        <p>The consistent team work coupled with perseverance, proper guidance, stimulating challenges have gained us numerous significant achievements. We have developed various projects such as “AndroidSentry: A Real Time Malware Detection Approach Integrated with Cloud Environment”, “FireAlert: An Early Warning System for Fire Detection based on IoT and Mobile Cloud” “VMGuard: VMI Assisted Architecture to Detection Intrusions in Cloud Environment, “vProVal: Introspection based Process Validation for Detecting Malware in KVM-based Cloud Environment”, “KVMInspector: KVM based Introspection Approach to Detect Malware in Cloud Environment”, “BNID: A Behavior-based Network Intrusion Detection at Network-Layer in Cloud Environment”, VMAnalyzer: Malware Semantic Analysis using Integrated CNN and Bi-Directional LSTM for Detecting VM-level Attacks in Cloud and VMProtector: Malign Process Detection for Protecting Virtual Machines in Cloud Environment etc. Currently, we are also working on the use of data visualization techniques and deep learning for malware detection and use of IoT and machine learning in smart farming practices. We promote the collaboration of external Indian & Foreign organizations to improve the quality of research and build a relationship with collaborating institutes and industries. Currently, we are collaborating in research with Advanced Cyber Security Research Center (ACSRC), The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, Australia and Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, University of Padua, Italy. Recently, there is an MoU initiated between International Center for AI and Cyber Security Research and Innovations, Asia University Taiwan and Foon University Dehradun. We are looking forward to add active and consistent students in our team. Those who would like to join the team, may contact the team mentor.</p>
